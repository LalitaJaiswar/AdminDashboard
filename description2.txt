							   -------------------------
							   
	Required functionalities: An administrator should be able to view:
	
	1. Received Tickets
	2. Completed Tickets
	3. Closed Tickets
	4. Lapsed Tickets
	5. Breached SLA(Service Level Agreement)
	6. Total Spent Hours
	
	Note: For Service Level Agreement(SLA), I have considered the following rules:
	
	1. If a ticket is raised then it should be resolved within the duration of 3 days.
	2. If a ticket is not resolved within 3 days then it will be considered as 
	   breaching of SLA.
